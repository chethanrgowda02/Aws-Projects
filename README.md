# README for Combined Cloud Computing Projects

## Overview

This document provides a detailed guide on various cloud computing tasks using Amazon Web Services (AWS). The projects focus on Identity and Access Management (IAM) and setting up infrastructure components such as storage, databases, load balancing, and autoscaling. These practical exercises aim to enhance cloud management skills and provide a solid foundation for handling real-world cloud environments.

## Projects Included

### 1. **IAM User Management and Policy Assignment**

   - **Creating IAM Users**: This section outlines the steps to create IAM users using the AWS Management Console. It covers how to set up user details, provide console access, and assign initial settings.
   - **Attaching Policies to IAM Users**: Learn how to attach existing AWS policies to IAM users to define their access levels and permissions.
   - **Adding IAM Users to Groups**: Steps to add IAM users to predefined groups to manage their permissions and access controls more efficiently.

### 2. **Cloud Infrastructure Setup**

   - **Setting Up S3 for Static Content**: This section provides instructions on creating an S3 bucket, enabling public access, uploading files, and configuring the bucket for static website hosting.
   - **Setting Up RDS for Database Management**: A step-by-step guide to creating a MySQL database using AWS RDS, configuring it for use, and connecting it with an EC2 instance. This includes setting up security groups, configuring inbound and outbound rules, and managing database connections via command-line interface.
   - **Setting Up Load Balancer and Autoscaling**: Learn how to create and configure an AWS Load Balancer to distribute traffic across multiple EC2 instances. The autoscaling setup is also explained to ensure the infrastructure scales automatically based on demand. This section covers creating load balancer listeners, target groups, and configuring health checks to monitor the availability of instances.

## Key Learning Outcomes

- Understand how to manage IAM roles, users, and policies for secure access control.
- Learn to set up and configure storage solutions using AWS S3, including static website hosting.
- Gain experience in creating and managing relational databases using AWS RDS, including connectivity with EC2 instances.
- Acquire skills in deploying load balancers and setting up autoscaling to maintain application reliability and performance.
